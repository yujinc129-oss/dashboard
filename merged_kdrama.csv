Meanwhile, Sul Woo is preparing for his secret mission. Unfortunately, he also has to deal with Cha Do Ha, Woon Guang's manager, who used to be the head of his fan club and is enamored with the celebrity. She is wary of Sul Woo and anxious that Woon Guang may be interested in him, so she constantly gets in Sul Woo's way.

But the overall theme of the show is love, which underlies the romance between a prince and his girl as well as the compassion for the country and people.(Source: MBC)~~ Adapted from the novel ""The Prince and the Pauper"" by Mark Twain.",2303,592
